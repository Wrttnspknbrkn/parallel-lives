- **Alternate Reality Generation**: AI generates personalized life paths with details like career outcomes, relationships, and emotional well-being.
- **Future Projections**: Simulations of life 5, 10, or 20 years into the future based on specific choices.
- **Visual Representations**: Interactive charts, graphs, and timelines to showcase alternate life paths.
- **Social Integration**: Share alternate life results with friends or compare with family members.
- **Gamified Exploration**: Earn badges for exploring unique or bold alternate realities.
- **Data Privacy**: User data is encrypted and securely managed with clear consent policies.
